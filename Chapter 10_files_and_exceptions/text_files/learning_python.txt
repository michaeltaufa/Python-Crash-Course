I am having fun learning Python learning language.
I have learned the importance of building functions and learned how to import modules.
I have enjoyed learning how to build classes and understanding the basic concept of inheritance.
Similar to importing modules, I can import classes.
Overall, I am enjoying my learning journey of Python.
