Program Name: Old School Runescape - Skills Description: This text file is focused on read_text() and write_text() for pyhton programs. Name: Michael Taufa Date: 2025-04-04 Title: Old School Runescape - Skills In Old School Runescape, my favorite skills to train is Slayer. I like training Slayer because because it provides a diverse amount of content to travel around Gilenor. One of the biggest advantages to training Slayer is that it is great skill to invest in the longtime for high level content. Training slayer provides exclusive monster content that only slayers can access. One of the famous weapons for slayer is the Abyssal Whip that is dropped by Abyssal Demons. To fight Abyssal Demons, a slayer level of 85 is needed. Abyssal Whips is a great weapon to farm and sell in the market for the cost for various targetted audidence. One experience I have not had the chance to try to use slayer to fight Slayer Bosses. I am working towards training slayer and will achieve the max level of 99 Slayer.
