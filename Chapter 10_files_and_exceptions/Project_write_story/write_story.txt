Hello everyone, I will be writing a story!
First, my favorite video game is Elden Ring, Dark Souls 3, Sekiro, Bloodborne, Dark Souls Remaster and more!
Other video games that I like playing is Old School Runescape.
Another video game I thought of that I like is the Resident Evil series!
RE4 Originaland RE4 Remake are great games
I also did not expect Resident Evil 2 Remake to be good, but it is GOOOOD.
Also, other games I found fun to play unexpedectly is Baldurs Gate 3 and Path of Exile 2.
The end
